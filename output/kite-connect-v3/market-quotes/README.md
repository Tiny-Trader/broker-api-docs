## Instruments[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#instruments "Permanent link")
Between multiple exchanges and segments, there are tens of thousands of different kinds of instruments that trade. Any application that facilitates trading needs to have a master list of these instruments. The instruments API provides a consolidated, import-ready CSV list of instruments available for trading.
### Retrieving the full instrument list[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#retrieving-the-full-instrument-list "Permanent link")
Unlike the rest of the calls that return JSON, the instrument list API returns a gzipped CSV dump of instruments across all exchanges that can be imported into a database. The dump is generated once everyday and hence last_price is not real time.
```
curl "https://api.kite.trade/instruments" \
  -H "X-Kite-Version: 3" \
  -H "Authorization: token api_key:access_token"

```

```
instrument_token, exchange_token, tradingsymbol, name, last_price, expiry, strike, tick_size, lot_size, instrument_type, segment, exchange

```

### CSV response columns[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#csv-response-columns "Permanent link")
column |
---|---
`instrument_token`string | Numerical identifier used for subscribing to live market quotes with the WebSocket API.
`exchange_token`string | The numerical identifier issued by the exchange representing the instrument.
`tradingsymbol`string | Exchange tradingsymbol of the instrument
`name`string | Name of the company (for equity instruments)
`last_price`float64 | Last traded market price
`expiry`string | Expiry date (for derivatives)
`strike`float64 | Strike (for options)
`tick_size`float64 | Value of a single price tick
`lot_size`int64 | Quantity of a single lot
`instrument_type`string | EQ, FUT, CE, PE
`segment`string | Segment the instrument belongs to
`exchange`string | Exchange
Warning
The instrument list API returns large amounts of data. It's best to request it once a day (ideally at around 08:30 AM) and store in a database at your end.
Note
For storage, it is recommended to use a combination of exchange and tradingsymbol as the unique key, not the numeric instrument token. Exchanges may reuse instrument tokens for different derivative instruments after each expiry.
## Market quotes[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#market-quotes "Permanent link")
The market quotes APIs enable you to retrieve market data snapshots of various instruments. These are snapshots gathered from the exchanges at the time of the request. For realtime streaming market quotes, use the [WebSocket](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/websocket/) API.
### Retrieving full market quotes[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#retrieving-full-market-quotes "Permanent link")
This API returns the complete market data snapshot of up to **500** instruments in one go. It includes the quantity, OHLC, and Open Interest fields, and the complete bid/ask market depth amongst others.
Instruments are identified by the `exchange:tradingsymbol` combination and are passed as values to the query parameter `i` which is repeated for every instrument. If there is no data available for a given key, the key will be absent from the response. The existence of all the instrument keys in the response map should be checked before to accessing them.
