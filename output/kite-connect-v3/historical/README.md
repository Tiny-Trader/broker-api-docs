Historical candle data
 Kite Connect 3 / API documentation

# Historical candle data[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#historical-candle-data "Permanent link")
The historical data API provides archived data (up to date as of the time of access) for instruments across various exchanges spanning back several years. A historical record is presented in the form of a _candle_ (Timestamp, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OI), and the data is available in several intervals—minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, hourly ... daily.
type | endpoint |
---|---|---
GET | [/instruments/historical/:instrument_token/:interval](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/) | Retrieve historical candle records for a given instrument.
### URI parameters[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#uri-parameters "Permanent link")
parameter |
---|---
`:instrument_token` | Identifier for the instrument whose historical records you want to fetch. This is obtained with the [instrument list](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/market-quotes/#retrieving-the-full-instrument-list) API.
`:interval` | The candle record interval. Possible values are:
· `minute`
· `day`
· `3minute`
· `5minute`
· `10minute`
· `15minute`
· `30minute`
· `60minute`
### Request parameters[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#request-parameters "Permanent link")
parameter |
---|---
`from` |  `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` formatted date indicating the start date of records
`to` |  `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` formatted date indicating the end date of records
`continuous` | Accepts `0` or `1`. Pass `1` to get continuous data
`oi` | Accepts `0` or `1`. Pass `1` to get OI data
### Response structure[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#response-structure "Permanent link")
The response is an array of records, where each record in turn is an array of the following values — `[timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume]`.
Note
It is possible to retrieve candles for small time intervals by making the `from` and `to` calls granular. For instance `from = 2017-01-01 09:15:00` and `to = 2017-01-01 09:30:00` to fetch candles for just 15 minutes between those timestamps.
## Continuous data[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#continuous-data "Permanent link")
It's important to note that the exchanges flush the `instrument_token` for futures and options contracts for every expiry. For instance, `NIFTYJAN18FUT` and `NIFTYFEB18FUT` will have different instrument tokens although their underlying contract is the same. The instrument master API only returns instrument_tokens for contracts that are live. It is not possible to retrieve instrument_tokens for expired contracts from the API, unless you regularly download and cache them.
This is where `continuous` API comes in which works for NFO and MCX futures contracts. Given a live contract's `instrument_token`, the API will return `day` candle records for the same instrument's expired contracts. For instance, assuming the current month is January and you pass `NIFTYJAN18FUT`'s `instrument_token` along with `continuous=1`, you can fetch day candles for December, November ... contracts by simply changing the `from` and `to` dates.
## Examples[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/historical/#examples "Permanent link")
```
# Fetch minute candles for NSE-ACC.
# This will return several days of minute data ending today.
# The time of request is assumed to be to be 01:30 PM, 1 Jan 2016,
# which is reflected in the latest (last) record.

# The data has been truncated with ... in the example responses.
