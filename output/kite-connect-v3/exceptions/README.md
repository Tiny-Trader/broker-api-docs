Exceptions and errors

 Kite Connect 3 / API documentation

# Exceptions and errors[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/exceptions/#exceptions-and-errors "Permanent link")
In addition to the `40x` and `50x` headers, error responses come with the name of the exception generated internally by the API server. You can define corresponding exceptions in your language or library, and raise them by doing a switch on the returned exception name.
### Example[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/exceptions/#example "Permanent link")
```
HTTP/1.1 500 Server error
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Error message",
    "error_type": "GeneralException"
}

```

Note
There are limitations at 200 orders per minute and 10 orders per second.
As a risk management measure, at Zerodha, a single user/API key will not be able to place more than 3000 orders per day. This restriction is across all segments and varieties.
Rate limitations also apply for order modification where a maximum of 25 modifications are allowed per order. Post that user has to cancel the order and place it again.
