## Glossary of constants[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#glossary-of-constants "Permanent link")
Here are several of the constant enum values used for placing orders.
param | values |
---|---|---
`variety` | `regular` | Regular order
| `amo` | After Market Order
| `co` | Cover Order
| `iceberg` | Iceberg Order
| `auction` | Auction Order
`order_type` | `MARKET` | Market order
| `LIMIT` | Limit order
| `SL` | Stoploss order
| `SL-M` | Stoploss-market order
`product` | `CNC` | Cash & Carry for equity
| `NRML` | Normal for futures and options
| `MIS` | Margin Intraday Squareoff for futures and options
| `MTF` | Margin Trading Facility
`validity` | `DAY` | Regular order
| `IOC` | Immediate or Cancel
| `TTL` | Order validity in minutes
`market_protection` | `0` | No market protection (default)

## Placing orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#placing-orders "Permanent link")
Placing an order implies registering it with the OMS via the API. This does not guarantee the order's receipt at the exchange. The fate of an order is dependent on several factors including market hours, availability of funds, risk checks and so on. Under normal circumstances, order placement, receipt by the OMS, transport to the exchange, execution, and the confirmation roundtrip happen instantly.
When an order is successfully placed, the API returns an `order_id`. The status of the order is not known at the moment of placing because of the aforementioned reasons.
In case of non-MARKET orders that may be open indefinitely during the course of a trading day, it is not practical to poll the order APIs continuously to know the status. For this, [postbacks](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/postbacks/) are ideal as they sent order updates asynchronously as they happen.
Note
Successful placement of an order via the API does not imply its successful execution. To know the true status of a placed order, you should scan the order history or retrieve the particular order's current details using its order_id.
### Order varieties[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#order-varieties "Permanent link")
You can place orders of different varieties—regular orders, after market orders, cover orders, iceberg orders etc. See the list of varieties [here](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#glossary-of-constants).
```
curl https://api.kite.trade/orders/regular \
    -H "X-Kite-Version: 3" \
    -H "Authorization: token api_key:access_token" \
    -d "tradingsymbol=ACC" \
    -d "exchange=NSE" \
    -d "transaction_type=BUY" \
    -d "order_type=MARKET" \
    -d "quantity=1" \
    -d "product=MIS" \
    -d "validity=DAY"

```

```
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "order_id": "151220000000000"
    }
  }

```

### Regular order parameters[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#regular-order-parameters "Permanent link")

`tag` | An optional tag to apply to an order to identify it (alphanumeric, max 20 chars)
## Modifying orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#modifying-orders "Permanent link")
As long as on order is open or pending in the system, certain attributes of it may be modified. It is important to sent the right value for `:variety` in the URL.
```
curl --request PUT https://api.kite.trade/orders/regular/151220000000000 \
    -H "X-Kite-Version: 3" \
    -H "Authorization: token api_key:access_token" \
    -d "order_type=MARKET" \
    -d "quantity=3" \
    -d "validity=DAY"

```

```
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "order_id": "151220000000000"
    }
}

```

## Cancelling orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#cancelling-orders "Permanent link")
As long as on order is open or pending in the system, it can be cancelled.
```
curl --request DELETE \
    "https://api.kite.trade/orders/regular/151220000000000" \

  }
}

```

## Retrieving orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#retrieving-orders "Permanent link")
The order history or the order book is transient as it only lives for a day in the system. When you retrieve orders, you get all the orders for the day including open, pending, and executed ones.
```
curl "https://api.kite.trade/orders" \
    -H "X-Kite-Version: 3" \
    -H "Authorization: token api_key:access_token"

```

```

## Order statuses[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#order-statuses "Permanent link")
The `status` field in the order response shows the current state of the order. The status values are largely self explanatory. The most common statuses are `OPEN`, `COMPLETE`, `CANCELLED`, and `REJECTED`.
An order can traverse through several interim and temporary statuses during its lifetime. For example, when an order is first placed or modified, it instantly passes through several stages before reaching its end state. Some of these are highlighted below.

## Tagging orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#tagging-orders "Permanent link")
Often, it may be necessary to tag and filter orders based on various criteria, for instance, to filter out all orders that came from a particular application or an `api_key` of yours. The `tag` field comes in handy here. It let's you send an arbitrary string while placing an order. This can be a unique ID, or something that indicates a particular type or context, for example. When the orderbook is retrieved, this value will be present in the `tag` field in the response.
## Market protection[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#market-protection "Permanent link")
Market protection is a feature that helps protect against extreme price movements when placing MARKET and SL-M (stoploss-market) orders. This feature allows you to set a percentage threshold to limit how much the order price can deviate from the current market price.
The `market_protection` parameter accepts the following values:

The protection percentage should be within the circuit limit's.
Note
Market protection is only applicable for MARKET and SL-M order types. It has no effect on LIMIT and SL orders as they already have built-in price protection.
## Auto slice orders[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#auto-slice-orders "Permanent link")
When placing orders with `autoslice=true` for quantities exceeding freeze limits, the API response remains the same format (single order object), but the order gets automatically split into multiple smaller orders internally. Each slice appears as a separate order in your orderbook with its own `order_id`. Auto sliced orders can be identified by the `"autoslice"` tag in the `tags` array, and child slices will have an additional tag like `"autoslice:parent_order_id"` to show the relationship. The maximum number of slices generated from a single auto slice order is 50.
## Multi-legged orders (CO)[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#multi-legged-orders-co "Permanent link")
Cover orders are "multi-legged" orders, where, a single order you place (first-leg) may spawn new orders (second-leg) based on the conditions you set on the first-leg order. These orders have special properties, where the first-leg order creates a position. The position is exited when the second-leg order is executed or cancelled.
These second-leg orders will have a `parent_order_id` field indicating the `order_id` of its parent order, that is, the first-leg order. This field may be required while modifying or cancelling an open second-leg order.

Every order, right after being placed, goes through multiple stages internally in the OMS. Initial validation, RMS (Risk Management System) checks and so on before it goes to the exchange. In addition, an open order, when modified, again goes through these stages.
## Retrieving all trades[¶](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/#retrieving-all-trades "Permanent link")
While an orders is sent as a single entity, it may be executed in arbitrary chunks at the exchange depending on market conditions. For instance, an order for 10 quantity of an instrument can be executed in chunks of 5, 1, 1, 3 or any such combination. Each individual execution that fills an order partially is a trade. An order may have one or more trades.
This API returns a list of all trades generated by all executed orders for the day.
