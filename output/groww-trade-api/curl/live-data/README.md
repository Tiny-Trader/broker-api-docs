# Live Data
Fetch live data of instruments easily using APIs.
## [Get Quote](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/curl/live-data#get-quote)
`GET https://api.groww.in/v1/live-data/quote`
This API provides the complete live data snapshot for an instrument including the latest price, market depth, ohlc, market volumes and much more. If one requires only the latest price data then the [Get LTP](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/curl/live-data#get-ltp) api should be used. Similarly if one is interested in getting only ohlc then [Get OHLC](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/curl/live-data#get-ohlc) api should be used. Use the segment value FNO for derivatives, CASH for stocks and index, and COMMODITY for commodity contracts.
### [Request](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/curl/live-data#request)

# You can also use wget
curl -X GET https://api.groww.in/v1/live-data/quote?exchange=NSE&segment=CASH&trading_symbol=NIFTY \
