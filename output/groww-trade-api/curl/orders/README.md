`GET https://api.groww.in/v1/order/trades/{groww_order_id}`

A single order might get executed in a single fulfilment, or as multiple smaller fulfilments. For example, an order of 100 quantity can get executed as 20-50-30 or any other combination. Since each of these fulfilments is defined as a trade, an order can be assigned to one or more trades. You can use groww_order_id to retrieve all the trades assigned to that order
