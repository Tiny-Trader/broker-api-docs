Place Order
# Orders
This guide describes how to manage orders using the SDK. You can create, modify, cancel, and retrieve order details for equities, derivatives, and commodities.
## [Place Order](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk/orders#place-order)
Use the place_order SDK method to register a new order. When successful, the method returns a unique order ID and its initial status.
### [Python SDK Usage](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk/orders#python-sdk-usage)
```
from growwapi import GrowwAPI

# Groww API Credentials (Replace with your actual credentials)
API_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_token"

# Initialize Groww API
groww = GrowwAPI(API_AUTH_TOKEN)

place_order_response = groww.place_order(
    trading_symbol="WIPRO",
    quantity=1,
    validity=groww.VALIDITY_DAY,
    exchange=groww.EXCHANGE_NSE,
    segment=groww.SEGMENT_CASH,
    product=groww.PRODUCT_CNC,
    order_type=groww.ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT, # You can also use ORDER_TYPE_MARKET, ORDER_TYPE_STOP_LOSS, ORDER_TYPE_STOP_LOSS_MARKET for different order types
    transaction_type=groww.TRANSACTION_TYPE_BUY,
    price=250,               # Optional: Price of the stock (for Limit orders)
    trigger_price=245,       # Optional: Trigger price (if applicable)
