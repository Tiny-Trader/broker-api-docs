# Orders
  * If you represent a business aiming to incorporate order flow management (including placing, canceling, and modifying orders), please visit the [Uplink Business](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/uplink-business/introduction). The direct HTTP order placement API integration is intended for individual API users.

  * In adherence to CDSL regulations, customers without a DDPI/POA are obligated to use a combination of the CDSL TPIN and OTP to provide the necessary authorization for the deduction of securities from their demat account when engaging in delivery sale transactions.
